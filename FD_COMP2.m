% This function applies the second-order compact finite difference scheme %
% described in [1] for the first derivative with alpha = 1/4. The         %
% boundary node scheme is taken as a second-order scheme as well, which   %
% is also given in [1], using alpha = 1. In cases where there are not     %
% enough points to apply the total second-order scheme, this function     %
% switches to a first-order scheme, and if there are still not enough     %
% points, the derivative is simply set to zero.                           %
