% This function applies the second-order explicit finite difference       %
% scheme to compute the derivative of a one-dimensional array. The        %
% boundary node scheme is taken as second-order as well. In cases where   %
% there are not enough points to apply the total second-order scheme,     %
% this function switches to a first-order scheme, and if there are still  %
% not enough points, the derivative is simply set to zero.                %
%                                                                         %
